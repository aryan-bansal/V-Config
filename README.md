### Hi, I'm @vikram-kangotra.
#### A complete computer enthusiast, including hardware and software, has just started digging into the dense world of computer science.
#### I've got an interest in extremes of computer, ranging from assembly programing to OS development. From creating my programming language to AI models from scratch (scratch as in raw, not the other one ðŸ™‚). I love to do most things from scratch.
#### My current toolkit of programming Language includes
- C/C++
- Java
- Python
- HTML and CSS (Programming Languages? You kidding me...)
- Javascript
- Ruby
- Bash
